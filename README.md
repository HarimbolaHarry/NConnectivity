# NConnectivity (WIP)

Welcome to NConnectivity.

For many years I always wanted to create a library that acts as a wrapper for sockets in C#.

But I never quite understood sockets and how they work until recently, now this library is still work in progress but it aims to make socket programming a bit easier for the newcommers!

Enjoy!
