# NConnectivity (WIP)

Welcome to NConnectivity.

For many years I always wanted to create a library that acts as a wrapper for sockets in C#.

But I never quite understood sockets and how they work until recently, now this library is still work in progress but it aims to make socket programming a bit easier for the newcommers!

Enjoy!

# But Why?

1) It's 100% Thread-Safe

2) It's lightweight

3) It's stable (But you gotta handle the exceptions yourself)

4) It's well documented

5) It fully supports TCP & UDP Protocols

6) TCP Protocol's Server supports multiple clients simultaneously and in an asynchronous manner

7) It's very easy to use 

8) It uses MIT License 

9) Example projects are provided
