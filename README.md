# NConnectivity (WIP)

Welcome to NConnectivity.

For many years I always wanted to create a library that acts as a wrapper for sockets in C#.

But I never quite understood sockets and how they work until recently, now this library is still work in progress but it aims to make socket programming a bit easier for the newcommers!

Enjoy!

# But Why?

1) It's 100% Thread-Safe

2) It's lightweight

3) It's stable (But you gotta handle the exceptions yourself)

4) It's well documented

5) It fully supports TCP & UDP Protocols (In the right way)

6) TCP Protocol's Server supports multiple clients simultaneously

7) It's easy as hell to use

8) It uses MIT License 

# How to use?

There are two examples projects in the visual studio solution, one glance and you got it, that's how easy it is!
